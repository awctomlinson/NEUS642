# General Resources

* Open-source datasets

    * [Collaborative research in computational neuroscience](https://crcns.org/)
	* [Comprehensive list of neuroscience databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neuroscience_databases)
	* [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset) - Although not specific to neuroscience, there are some neuroscience datasets available here). 

* Free Jupyter servers. You will have to get the data and notebooks you are working on uploaded to these servers. Computational performance on these servers may be slow, which is why we are using exajupyter instead despite the off-campus access complications.

    * [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) - Your notebooks and data will be stored on your personal Google Drive account.
    * [Microsoft Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com) - This one allows you to clone a Github repository, which makes it easier to pull in the NEUS642 resources from our Github repo, https://github.com/bburan/NEUS642.

* Additional learning resources
    * [Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/)
	* [Python Neurobootcamp](https://github.com/dasaderi/python_neurobootcamp) - Various exercises in neuroscience from OHSU's NGP winter bootcamp.

* Python documentation and help resources
    * [Documentation for Python](https://www.python.org/doc/)
    * [Documentation for Numpy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/)
    * [Documentation for Scipy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/)
    * [Documentation for Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/contents.html)
    * [Documentation for IPython](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/index.html)
    * [Documentation for Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/)

	* [Python Tutor Mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/tutor) - Once subscribed, you can post questions to the mailing list at tutor@python.org.
	
* Miscellaneous online tutorials
	* [How to make complex plots in Python](https://github.com/RainCloudPlots/RainCloudPlots) - See the `tutorial_python` folder. You can run this tutorial in [binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/RainCloudPlots/RainCloudPlots/master?filepath=tutorial_python%2Fraincloud_tutorial_python.ipynb).
