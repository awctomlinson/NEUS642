Python
------
We will be using Python 3.6 for the course. Some of you may be familiar with older versions of Python such as Python 2.7. However, many popular third-party packages that you may use in your research (e.g., Numpy, Scipy and Pandas) will [no longer support Python 2 after 2020](https://python3statement.org). If you have been using Python 2, take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the [differences](http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_python_2_3_key_diff.html).

Getting started
---------------
There are several ways to run Python code. For this class, we will use [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org). Notebooks are documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. If you have an OHSU account, you can use the [exajupyter server](exajupyter.md). To access this from off-campus, you will likely need to request remote access from IT using either [VPN](https://o2.ohsu.edu/information-technology-group/help-desk/it-help-pages/vpn-install-win7.cfm) or [Citrix Receiver](https://o2.ohsu.edu/information-technology-group/help-desk/it-help-pages/remote-windows-web.cfm).


Setting up Python
-----------------
These days I recommend the [Anaconda Python Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com) since it is free to use (both for commercial and academic use), can be installed on computers without administrative privileges and makes it easy to install various third-party Python packages. To get started with your own copy of Python::

* [Download](https://www.anaconda.com/download) the installer and run it. Select all default options.

* On Windows the installer will create a new shortcut on your desktop called "Anaconda Prompt". Run this shortcut to open the Anaconda shell. 


Working with Python
-------------------
You need a way to write Python code. The best way to do this is to use a dedicated code editor. There are many options out there, so if you already have a preferred one feel free to use it.
