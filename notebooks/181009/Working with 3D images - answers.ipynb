    "**The problem:** You are screening a lot of tissue samples on a confocal microscope, creating many z-stack 3-dimensional images. In order to examine all of your images in a timely manner you want to to create a representative 2-dimensional image from each of your z-stack images. In this case, a maximum intensity projection will do the trick but the microscope software only allows you to make these one at a time and this takes a long time. Ideally you would like to automate this and write a script that can iterate through all of your images and create maximum intensity projections for all of your images in batch. Python allows us to do this, but how?\n",
    "\n",
    "**The answer:** NumPy arrays!\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will demonstrate how 3-dimensional microscopy image data can be loaded into a NumPy array and manipulated mathematically. The 3-D image consists of a series of 2-D pictures taken of a section of tissue at various depths (the \"z\" dimension). The collection of 2-D slices is known as a z-stack. The \"data\" that will be loaded into the NumPy array from the image will be the intensity value (how bright the color is) of every pixel for each slice.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be easier to analyze--and easier to visualize--a single image than a whole series of images. Thus, a common practice when analyzing 3-D microscopy data is to create a maximum intensity projection, or a single image that combines all of the slices in the z-stack. The final image will have the same X and Y dimensions as the other slices, but the intensity value for each (X,Y) pixel coordinate will be whatever the highest intensity value was for that coordinate across each of the z slices. Thus, the brightest possible image will be displayed, and all of the important structures throughout the tissue can be seen in the single image. This notebook will cover how to mathematically create a maximum intensity projection (MIP) from a z-stack loaded into a NumPy array.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to export the resulting MIP image so it can be viewed or analyzed with other standard software. This notebook will save the image into a .tif file format, which is a commonly used high-quality file format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, it can be interesting or useful to visualize the 3-D tissue from a different angle. This notebook will demonstrate how to generate an orthogonal image to view the tissue section when it is turned 90 degrees to the left or right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, this notebook will define functions to automate the creation of MIP and orthogonal images (saved as TIFs) for all microscopy images in a folder, which is ultimately much faster than manually using the microscope software to do this.\n",

    "First, we need to import libraries that will allow us to access the data in our files and utilize the data. Here we are importing **czifile** which is a module for opening the propritary czi file format from Carl Zeiss Zen software. This was created by Christoph Gohlke from UC Irvine. Documentation regarding czifile is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/AllenCellModeling/czifile) or [Czifile](https://www.pydoc.io/pypi/czifile-0.1.1/autoapi/czifile/index.html). We will also import the [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) library as np which will allow us to work with the data as an array. Also, [os](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/os.html) allows Python to access documents via file handles through directories. [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is a library that will allow us to plot the image data from the NumPy array. \"%matplotlib inline\" just tells the Jupyter notebook to plot the images from Matplotlib in the notebook so that we can see them. Finally, we will import [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) which will allow us to write out new TIF files after we create our new images."

    "If we think about our z-stack as a 3D image, it has X, Y, and Z axes. If you have worked with maximum intensity images before, you know that the result is a 2D image where the Z axis gets compressed. In order to go from a 3D to 2D image in this way, you ask the computer to plot a new image where for each X,Y coordinate the computer goes through each of the Z values (each slice) and it calculates which value (voxel) is the greatest. The computer then plots that value for that X,Y coordinate and moves to the next coordinate. This ultimately results in a 2D image where for each X,Y coordinate, the maximum value within the Z axis is plotted. There are alternative ways of doing projections depending on what information you want, such as average intensity, etc., but the most commonly used is the maximum which we will use here.\n",
