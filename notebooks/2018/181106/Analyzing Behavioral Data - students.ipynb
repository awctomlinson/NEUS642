    "The vagus nerve is a nerve that runs along the neck. It controls the functions of the heart, lungs and digestive tract, as well as sends updated sensory information regarding the state of these organs to the brain. \n",
    "\n",
    "The selectivity of neurons in sensory cortex, including the primary auditory cortex (A1), can be modified by pairing neuromodulator (acetylcholine and norepinephrine) release with sensory stimulation. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a safe and effective way to trigger the release of neuromodulators with a high degree of temporal control. By repeated pairing of tonal sounds (sensory stimulation) with VNS, for example, alters neurons' spectral tuning and induces specific and long-lasting plasticity in A1. Based on the capacity to drive specific changes in neural circuitry, VNS paired with experience has been successful in effectively ameliorating animal models of chronic tinnitus, stroke, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Although there are evidences showing VNS-tone pairing can promote A1 cortical plasticity, there is no data showing how VNS-tone pairing would affect behavioral performances, such as tone or sound recognition. Hence, the Stephen lab is interested in finding out whether VNS-tone pairing can increase the speed of learning to identify different tones.\n",

    "After surgery, animals were trained to perform a tone-reward association task using classical conditioning method. In the behavioral task, two tones (either higher or lower frequency) and references (noise) were presented to animals. One out of the two tones was associated with a liquid reward while the other tone has no reward. In one training session, for example, we set the higher frequency tone to associate with a reward. In the next session, we set the lower frequency tone to have a reward. This is to train animals to identify which tone was associated with a reward within a training session. The below picture is a schematic showing how a trial of the tone-reward association task was carried out.      \n",
