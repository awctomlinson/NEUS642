    "Today we will be using electrophysiology data to better understand how a particular set of drugs effect GABA release onto a specific subset of cells. Electrophysiology is a technique that is used to measure electrical changes in cells. In this particular example, we will be using whole-cell voltage clamp recording data. With this technique, we lower a glass pipette down to the surface of the cell membrane and develop a tight seal with the cell membrane. Then we \"break in\" to the cell membrane, meaning that the fluid within our pipette tip is continuous with the intracellular fluid within the cell. This allows us electrical access to the cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizing this electical access, we can inject current to maintain a specific voltage within our cell of interest. For this experiment, we inject current to keep the cell membrane at -70mV, the resting membrane potential of neurons in this area of the brain. Fluctuations from this 'baseline' represent changes in voltage and can tell us about cellular signaling and channel activy within the cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this experiment, we were interested in assessing the GABAergic miniature inhibitory post-synaptic current (mIPSC).\n",
    "############ It's a mIPSC, you were right :) Also, it's an inward current because of the driving force when we hold our membrane at -70mV, with the external and internal solutions that we're using, Cl- flows out of the neuron at -70mV, so when the GABA binds to and opens the GABA-A channel Cl- flows out of the neuron. Minus charge flowing out of the cell is inward current. I'm not really sure how it hyperpolarizes the cell... so that confuses me but that's what Minghua said :) \n",
    "\n",
    "GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter whose transmission hyperpolarizes the neuron (through chloride and potassium channels). GABAergic mIPSCs are a way to investigate spontaneous GABA release, by blocking action potentials and glutamate signaling we can sequester GABA spontaneous release through these recordings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the downward reflections in a recording represents GABA release onto our recording cell, as we are measureing the post-synaptic effect, or the change in post-synaptic potential. Drugs can have a major effect on neural signaling processes, the goal of this experiment to examine the effect of two different drugs on GABAergic mIPSP characteristics. The characteristics that we are interested in are the input current, the rise time, the decay, and the inter-event intervals, as well as the frequency of the events within a condition (drug vs no drug). \n",

I always encourage the use of the `.loc[rows, cols]` approach since it is much less ambiguous and it's explicit whether you're trying to extract rows or columns. As for the notes in the comments below, I agree that it's best to use the `df[column]` syntax as opposed to the `df.column` syntax. While either is fine, if your column name is `mean`, this conflicts with a method that already exists on dataframes called `mean` (and therefore, you'd have to access that column using the `df[mean]` syntax). Since there are many, many methods on a dataframe that may conflict wiht column names, being consistent and always using the square brackets approach, you don't need to worry about whether `df.column` is actually a method or the column values.</font>"
