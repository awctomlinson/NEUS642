While you are welcome to email the course staff directly, we prefer that Python-related questions be posted to Slack. You may learn from our answers to questions posted by other students and are encouraged to answer each other's questions. During class, you are also encouraged to use Slack to discuss the exercises. Please share anything interesting you find with us on Slack or let us know if you'e confused about a particular topic.\n",

    "Each week you or one of your classmates will lead an exercise on a data analysis problem relevant to neuroscience. Be sure that you provide sufficient background information at the beginning of the exercise for a neuroscientist to understand the problem. Throughout the exercise there will be points at which we stop for 5 to 15 minutes to give you the opportunity to write the solution for a particular question. You may work either individually or in groups.\n",

    "\n",
    "Although I will be running today's exercise, all subsequent exercises will be run by one of you. If you haven't already, please sign up for a slot. If preferred, you may work in small groups of two to three people. You are expected to be in regular contact with the course staff as you develop the exercise so that we can guide you and ensure the exercise is of appropriate scope and level for the class. Be sure to contact us early. You are expected to have a concept ready at least two weeks before your presentation slot and a full draft of the exercise complete a full week before your presentation slot.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now, let's download today's notebook. To make it easy to get future updates to the notebooks, we are going to use Git, which is a source-code management tool. To get started, we will be using the command prompt. The command prompt is a program that allows you to interact with your computer using the keyboard instead of a mouse:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Open `Anaconda Prompt`.\n",
    "* Change to the directory where you want to store your files for NEUS642.\n",
    "* Type `git clone https://github.com/bburan/NEUS642`\n",
    "\n",
    "If the last step fails, it means you need to install Git. While still in the `Anaconda Prompt`, type `conda install git`. Now, try the last step again. Once you have successfully run the last step, you will now have a folder called `NEUS642`. The next step is to make sure you have all the Python packages you need to run the code. If you followed the instructions in the syllabus, you should already have all the required packages. If not, type in the `Anaconda Prompt`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install python matplotlib seaborn numpy pandas jupyter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You may not discover until later today that you are missing a package. If you discover this, just open up an `Anaconda Prompt` and run the above command.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* Change to the folder where you cloned the notebooks by typing `cd NEUS642`.\n",
    "* Start Jupyter Notebook by typing `jupyter notebook`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A web browser should immediately open and load Jupyter Notebook. Navigate to today's notebook (under `notebooks/2020/200107`) and open `working with dataframes - students.ipynb`. You'll note that we have four versions of each notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `base` - This is the version you will create when authoring your own exercise. It contains all the answers to the exercises. The course staff has a script that will take this version and create three formatted versions of the notebook for use in the class. The formatted versions all contain a table of contents with links to easily navigate the notebook. Once you're ready to create the notebook for the class, the course staff will provide you instructions on how to properly format it so it works with the script.\n",
    "* `students` - This is the version that you will use. The answers have been removed from the notebook so that you can enter your own solution.\n",
    "* `teacher` - This is the version used by the presenter. The answers have been removed from the notebook, but will automatically be loaded once you execute the cell (note you will need to execute the cell twice, once to load the solution and again to run the solution).\n",
    "* `answers` - Same as `base`, except it contains a nicely-formatted table of contents.\n",

    "1. Reshaping the data.\n",

    "3. Grouping data and computing a statistic on the group.\n",

    "Dataframes are provided using a Python library called [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). In the code I've imported pandas as `pd` for short. This two-letter abbreviation is a common convention in scientific Python programming (you'll often see numpy imported as `np` and scipy as `sp`). Since Pandas is a third-party library not included in the core Python distribution, you sometimes have to explicitly install it. It should already be installed if you . However, if you try to replicate the code using your own Python install, you may have to install Pandas using `conda install pandas`.\n",

    "## The data\n",
    "\n",
    "Noise exposure can cause hearing damage. Sometimes this damage is temporary, sometimes it's permanent. We can assess hearing thresholds in animals by measuring the auditory brainstem response (ABR). The ABR is an event-related potential reflecting the activity of the auditory nerve in response to a brief tone. By presenting tones of varying loudness (the unit is dB SPL), we can define the animal's hearing threshold as the minimum level (dB SPL) at which we can detect the ABR.\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess hearing damage caused by noise exposure, we can measure ABR thresholds before noise-exposure, one day after noise-exposure and two weeks after noise-exposure. We have a set of animals that have been exposed to different levels of noise (104, 110 or 114 dB SPL). In this exercise, we will calculate and plot the mean threshold shift (i.e., the difference between post-exposure ABR threshold and pre-exposure ABR threshold).\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is saved in two spreadsheets. The first contains the information on the noise-exposure for each animal and the second contains the ABR threshold measurements."
