    "We will be analyzing data from a psychoacoustical task in which the subjects (gerbils) are asked to listen to a five-second tone that may be amplitude-modulated. After listening to the tone, they must provide a response if they think they heard an amplitude-modulation. The difficulty of the task is varied by changing the degree of amplitude modulation from 0% (no modulation) to 100% (maximum modulation).\n",

    "## Why import?\n",
    "As an aside (not for discussion during class unless you have questions). If you're a Matlab user, you might think that the need to explicitly specify imports is a major disadvantage of Python. However, there are two advantages of specifying imports. First, you can reuse function names as long as they live in different modules. For example, there are several `log` functions available:\n",
    "\n",
    "    from math import log\n",
    "    from numpy import log\n",
    "   \n",
    "The first one (available in `math`, which is always bundled with the core Python distribution) isn't smart enough to work with Numpy arrays or Pandas dataframes. But, the second one (available in `numpy`, which is a third-party library) is. So, you'd just import the one that you wanted to use. However, if you were using Matlab, there's no good way to tell Matlab which one you want to use. Instead, the functions would likely be named `log` and `numpy_log` to avoid *name collisions*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second reason why specifying imports is often a good thing is because Matlab must load **every** single installed library and toolbox before it is ready to run your code. This can be quite slow if you have a lot of third-party libraries and/or toolboxes installed. In contrast, Python only loads the modules you specify using `import`."
