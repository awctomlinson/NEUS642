    "One more thing we might want to do. We don't really care about fractions of a milligram, so let's get rid of the decimal and print out just `3400` instead of `3400.0`. How might we do this? There are two options.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `format` method converts the variable to a string based on it's type. If the variable is an integer, it will not have the decimal after it. So, we could simply call `int` after converting the quantity to milligrams.\n",

    "The number of [permutations for a format specification are vast](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html). However, in scientific Python programming one of the most common uses will be to control the number of decimal places, so your syntax will look like:\n",
