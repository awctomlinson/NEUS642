    "Today we will be using electrophysiology data to better understand how a particular set of drugs effect GABA release. Electrophysiology is a technique that is used to measure electrical changes in cells. In this example, we will be using whole-cell voltage clamp recording data. With this technique, we lower a glass pipette down to the surface of the cell membrane and develop a tight seal with the cell membrane. Then we \"break in\" to the cell membrane, meaning that the fluid within our pipette tip is continuous with the intracellular fluid within the cell. This allows us electrical access to the cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizing this electical access, we can inject current to maintain a specific voltage within the cell. For this experiment, we inject current to keep the cell membrane at -70mV, the resting membrane potential of neurons in this area of the brain. Fluctuations from this 'baseline' represent changes in voltage and can tell us about cellular signaling and channel activy within the cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "<font color = 'purple'> Yang, read the sentence above, do fluctuations in the 'baseline' represent changes in VOLTAGE or changes in CURRENT? When you're in voltage clamp you're measuring the current, right? haaaaalllpp! </font> <br>    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color = 'bear'> Courtney, yes in voltage clamp we measure current! Before my thinking was that since *current* is measured, fluctuations represent changes in *current*, but now that I read this paragram a second time, I think you've got a good point too! Experimentally we are holding the cell at a fixed voltage, but physiologically you would expect changes in voltage. So I agree that these \"fluctuations\" can reflect changes in voltage. Depends on the way you think about voltage clamp-- what gets measured vs the measurements' physiological meaning. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=\"blue\">Keep this simple otherwise you will confuse the class. Just say that in voltage clamp mode, you are holding the cell at a fixed resting potential (-70 mV). Ion channels in the cell's membrane result in current flowing in or out of the cell. Normally these currents would lead to a change in the cell's membrane voltage. However, you inject current into the cell to counteract these currents, thereby maintaining the cell's potential at -70 mV. Here, you record the amount of current injected into the cell as a proxy for the current generated by the ion channel. This data is then used to deduce how these ion channels work.</font>\n",

    "In this experiment, we used electrophysiology to assess the GABAergic miniature inhibitory post-synaptic current (mIPSC).\n",

    "\n",
    "<font color=\"blue\">This is the appropriate place to discuss the role of TTX, NBQX, Cd and RIM. For example: Action potentials generate large currents that mask the small contributions from post-synaptic currents. By adding TTX to the incubation medium, you can prevent these action potentials from forming, thereby enabling you to measure the small currents generated by various ion channels. To isolate the role of a particular channel (or family of channels), you need to use various agonists and antagonists. For example, NBQX is an antagonist of AMPA receptors (i.e., it blocks the activity of these receptors). By adding NBQX to the incubation media, you can rule out AMPA receptors as the source of the currents you measure. What about Cd and RIM? Can you explain these better, please?</font>\n",
    "    \n",
    "GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter whose transmission hyperpolarizes the neuron (through chloride and potassium channels). GABAergic mIPSCs are a way to investigate spontaneous GABA release, by blocking action potentials and glutamate signaling we can sequester GABA spontaneous release through these recordings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the downward reflections in a recording represents GABA release onto our recording cell, as we are measuring the post-synaptic effect, or the change in post-synaptic potential. Drugs can have a major effect on neural signaling processes, the goal of this experiment to examine the effect of two different drugs on GABAergic mIPSP characteristics. The characteristics that we are interested in are the input current, the rise time, the decay, and the inter-event intervals, as well as the frequency of the events within a condition (drug vs no drug).
